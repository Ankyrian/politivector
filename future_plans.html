                <p class="title">Questions</p>
                <p class="description">Currently, the questions in the test are of our mildly informed making. These
                    questions were formulated using the most basic topics of discussion in politics and political
                    philosophy. Our intention, after Politivector proves itself to be a valuable project, is to rework
                    the questions to make the evaluation algorithm more accurate and informational.</p>
                <p class="description">The ultimate goal regarding the veracity of the questions available in
                    Politivector is to prepare a set of educated questions with experts and professors willing to
                    participate in this project.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plan">
                <p class="title">Data</p>
                <p class="description">Right now, Politivector obtains absolutely no data from its users whatsoever.
                    While data collection and analysis for a small-scale project such as Politivector is a distant goal,
                    we wish to be able to compare test takers’ results —anonymous results, of course— and present a
                    comprehensive image regarding the distribution of ideologies across the world.</p>
                <p class="description">One thought-through feature is to add a country, and maybe city, selector. This
                    location information provided would allow us to display ideological maps of our anonymous test
                    takers’ countries. The information portrayed by such distribution and concentration maps could be
                    especially useful in demographic, social, and political studies.</p>
                <p class="description">Another possibility is to apply various data science methods to the data provided
                    to us by our test takers. One specific method is “clustering”. Clustering would allow us to group
                    together data points, seeing if they agree on a common center.</p>
                <p class="description">This analysis could present many new perspectives regarding the status of
                    political philosophy in the modern world, such as how fragmented certain ideologies are, which
                    political parties best satiate their peoples’ needs, and where a newcomer into politics could align
                    themselves as a starting point.</p>
                <p class="description">Data collection and analysis is probably the most intricate of our long-term
                    goals, which is why it is the enhancement we wish to implement last.</p>

            <div class="plan">
                <p class="title">Results</p>
                <p class="description">Currently, we are using a simple percentage bar format to display test results.
                    There are much more imaginative ways of visualizing information, some of which we may choose to add
                    into Politivector.</p>
                <p class="description">A conventional format is the political compass, which is a 2D plane containing
                    Authoritarian/Liberal and Economic Left/Right axes. This form of visualization cannot be applied to
                    all 12 dimensions of Politivector (humans are not good at comprehending 12D), but affiliated
                    dimensions could be “plotted” against one another.</p>
                <p class="description">We will further discuss what visuals could be used to display information output
                    by Politivector, and include ones we see informational and attractive.</p>

                <p class="title">Philosophers' Round</p>
                <p class="description">The Politivector team sees politics as much more than a simple war of labels. We
                    believe politics to be a physical manifestation of greater philosophical discussions regarding
                    ideals, optimization, ethics, and countless more concepts.</p>
                <p class="description">We have the intention to either expand the current test or make an additional one
                    to include questions about one’s philosophical stance rather than a practical one. From that test,
                    we want to direct test takers to various philosophical works partially reflecting their beliefs,
                    consequently driving people to self-improve.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plan">
                <p class="title">Much More!</p>
                <p class="description">We will establish channels of communication to receive feedback from our test
                    takers, and improve Politivector in ways we could not imagine.</p>
